# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests
===============================================

In this project, we will learn :
	- unittest — Unit testing framework
	- unittest.mock — mock object library
	- How to mock a readonly property with mock?
	- parameterized
	- Memoization

-----------------------------------------------------------
## Task 0:
Familiarize yourself with the utils.access_nested_map function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.

In this task you will write the first unit test for utils.access_nested_map.

Create a TestAccessNestedMap class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.

Implement the TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.

## Task 1
Implement TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map_exception. Use the assertRaises context manager to test that a KeyError is raised for the following inputs (use @parameterized.expand):

## Task 2
Familiarize yourself with the utils.get_json function.

Define the TestGetJson(unittest.TestCase) class and implement the TestGetJson.test_get_json method to test that utils.get_json returns the expected result.

We don’t want to make any actual external HTTP calls. Use unittest.mock.patch to patch requests.get.

## Task 3:
Read about memoization and familiarize yourself with the utils.memoize decorator.

Implement the TestMemoize(unittest.TestCase) class with a test_memoize method.
Use unittest.mock.patch to mock a_method. Test that when calling a_property twice, the correct result is returned but a_method is only called once using assert_called_once.

## Task 4:
Familiarize yourself with the client.GithubOrgClient class.

In a new test_client.py file, declare the TestGithubOrgClient(unittest.TestCase) class and implement the test_org method.

This method should test that GithubOrgClient.org returns the correct value.

Use @patch as a decorator to make sure get_json is called once with the expected argument but make sure it is not executed.

Use @parameterized.expand as a decorator to parametrize the test with a couple of org examples to pass to GithubOrgClient, in this order:

google
abc
Of course, no external HTTP calls should be made.

## Task 5:
memoize turns methods into properties. Read up on how to mock a property (see resource).

Implement the test_public_repos_url method to unit-test GithubOrgClient._public_repos_url.

Use patch as a context manager to patch GithubOrgClient.org and make it return a known payload.

Test that the result of _public_repos_url is the expected one based on the mocked payload.

## Task 6:
Implement TestGithubOrgClient.test_public_repos to unit-test GithubOrgClient.public_repos.

Use @patch as a decorator to mock get_json and make it return a payload of your choice.

Use patch as a context manager to mock GithubOrgClient._public_repos_url and return a value of your choice.

Test that the list of repos is what you expect from the chosen payload.

Test that the mocked property and the mocked get_json was called once.

## Task 7
Implement TestGithubOrgClient.test_has_license to unit-test GithubOrgClient.has_license.

## Task 8
We want to test the GithubOrgClient.public_repos method in an integration test. That means that we will only mock code that sends external requests.

Create the TestIntegrationGithubOrgClient(unittest.TestCase) class and implement the setUpClass and tearDownClass which are part of the unittest.TestCase API.
The setupClass should mock requests.get to return example payloads found in the fixtures.

Use patch to start a patcher named get_patcher, and use side_effect to make sure the mock of requests.get(url).json() returns the correct fixtures for the various values of url that you anticipate to receive.

Implement the tearDownClass class method to stop the patcher.
